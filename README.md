# Conway's game of life

Implementation of Conway's game of life in Python, using pygame.

You may flip squares by clicking on them. You may perform a variety of other actions by clicking on the buttons at the bottom. The play and pause buttons do what you would expect, the arrows are for stepping forward and backward (maximum 10 places back), the + and - control the framerate and the X clears the entire board.

You may save the board's current state (only one savestate at a time).
